v0.4.4 (released December 30, 2016):

- Added support for Python 3.6.
- Fixed parsing bugs involving:
  - wikitables nested in templates;
  - wikitable error recovery when unable to recurse;
  - templates nested in template parameters before other parameters.
- Fixed parsing file-like objects.
- Made builds deterministic.
- Documented caveats.

v0.4.3 (released October 29, 2015):

- Added Windows binaries for Python 3.5.
- Fixed edge cases involving wikilinks inside of external links and vice versa.
- Fixed a C tokenizer crash when a keyboard interrupt happens while parsing.

v0.4.2 (released July 30, 2015):

- Fixed setup script not including header files in releases.
- Fixed Windows binary uploads.

v0.4.1 (released July 30, 2015):

- The process for building Windows binaries has been fixed, and these should be
  distributed along with new releases. Windows users can now take advantage of
  C speedups without having a compiler of their own.
- Added support for Python 3.5.
- '<' and '>' are now disallowed in wikilink titles and template names. This
  includes when denoting tags, but not comments.
- Fixed the behavior of preserve_spacing in Template.add() and keep_field in
  Template.remove() on parameters with hidden keys.
- Removed _ListProxy.detach(). SmartLists now use weak references and their
  children are garbage-collected properly.
- Fixed parser bugs involving:
  - templates with completely blank names;
  - templates with newlines and comments.
- Heavy refactoring and fixes to the C tokenizer, including:
  - corrected a design flaw in text handling, allowing for substantial speed
    improvements when parsing long strings of plain text;
  - implemented new Python 3.3 PEP 393 Unicode APIs.
- Fixed various bugs in SmartList, including one that was causing memory issues
  on 64-bit builds of Python 2 on Windows.
- Fixed some bugs in the release scripts.

v0.4 (released May 23, 2015):

- The parser now falls back on pure Python mode if C extensions cannot be
  built. This fixes an issue that prevented some Windows users from installing
  the parser.
- Added support for parsing wikicode tables (patches by David Winegar).
- Added a script to test for memory leaks in scripts/memtest.py.
- Added a script to do releases in scripts/release.sh.
- skip_style_tags can now be passed to mwparserfromhell.parse() (previously,
  only Parser().parse() allowed it).
- The 'recursive' argument to Wikicode's filter methods now accepts a third
  option, RECURSE_OTHERS, which recurses over all children except instances of
  'forcetype' (for example, `code.filter_templates(code.RECURSE_OTHERS)`
  returns all un-nested templates).
- The parser now understands HTML tag attributes quoted with single quotes.
  When setting a tag attribute's value, quotes will be added if necessary. As
  part of this, Attribute's 'quoted' attribute has been changed to 'quotes',
  and is now either a string or None.
- Calling Template.remove() with a Parameter object that is not part of the
  template now raises ValueError instead of doing nothing.
- Parameters with non-integer keys can no longer be created with
  'showkey=False', nor have the value of this attribute be set to False later.
- _ListProxy.destroy() has been changed to _ListProxy.detach(), and now works
  in a more useful way.
- If something goes wrong while parsing, ParserError will now be raised.
  Previously, the parser would produce an unclear BadRoute exception or allow
  an incorrect node tree to be build.
- Fixed parser bugs involving:
  - nested tags;
  - comments in template names;
  - tags inside of <nowiki> tags.
- Added tests to ensure that parsed trees convert back to wikicode without
  unintentional modifications.
- Added support for a NOWEB environment variable, which disables a unit test
  that makes a web call.
- Test coverage has been improved, and some minor related bugs have been fixed.
- Updated and fixed some documentation.

v0.3.3 (released April 22, 2014):

- Added support for Python 2.6 and 3.4.
- Template.has() is now passed 'ignore_empty=False' by default instead of True.
  This fixes a bug when adding parameters to templates with empty fields, and
  is a breaking change if you rely on the default behavior.
- The 'matches' argument of Wikicode's filter methods now accepts a function
  (taking one argument, a Node, and returning a bool) in addition to a regex.
- Re-added 'flat' argument to Wikicode.get_sections(), fixed the order in which
  it returns sections, and made it faster.
- Wikicode.matches() now accepts a tuple or list of strings/Wikicode objects
  instead of just a single string or Wikicode.
- Given the frequency of issues with the (admittedly insufficient) tag parser,
  there's a temporary skip_style_tags argument to parse() that ignores '' and
  ''' until these issues are corrected.
- Fixed a parser bug involving nested wikilinks and external links.
- C code cleanup and speed improvements.

v0.3.2 (released September 1, 2013):

- Added support for Python 3.2 (along with current support for 3.3 and 2.7).
- Renamed Template.remove()'s first argument from 'name' to 'param', which now
  accepts Parameter objects in addition to parameter name strings.

v0.3.1 (released August 29, 2013):

- Fixed a parser bug involving URLs nested inside other markup.
- Fixed some typos.

v0.3 (released August 24, 2013):

- Added complete support for HTML Tags, including forms like <ref>foo</ref>,
  <ref name="bar"/>, and wiki-markup tags like bold ('''), italics (''), and
  lists (*, #, ; and :).
- Added support for ExternalLinks (http://example.com/ and
  [http://example.com/ Example]).
- Wikicode's filter methods are now passed 'recursive=True' by default instead
  of False. This is a breaking change if you rely on any filter() methods being
  non-recursive by default.
- Added a matches() method to Wikicode for page/template name comparisons.
- The 'obj' param of Wikicode.insert_before(), insert_after(), replace(), and
  remove() now accepts other Wikicode objects and strings representing parts of
  wikitext, instead of just nodes. These methods also make all possible
  substitutions instead of just one.
- Renamed Template.has_param() to has() for consistency with Template's other
  methods; has_param() is now an alias.
- The C tokenizer extension now works on Python 3 in addition to Python 2.7.
- Various bugfixes, internal changes, and cleanup.

v0.2 (released June 20, 2013):

- The parser now fully supports Python 3 in addition to Python 2.7.
- Added a C tokenizer extension that is significantly faster than its Python
  equivalent. It is enabled by default (if available) and can be toggled by
  setting `mwparserfromhell.parser.use_c` to a boolean value.
- Added a complete set of unit tests covering parsing and wikicode
  manipulation.
- Renamed Wikicode.filter_links() to filter_wikilinks() (applies to ifilter as
  well).
- Added filter methods for Arguments, Comments, Headings, and HTMLEntities.
- Added 'before' param to Template.add(); renamed 'force_nonconformity' to
  'preserve_spacing'.
- Added 'include_lead' param to Wikicode.get_sections().
- Removed 'flat' param from Wikicode.get_sections().
- Removed 'force_no_field' param from Template.remove().
- Added support for Travis CI.
- Added note about Windows build issue in the README.
- The tokenizer will limit itself to a realistic recursion depth to prevent
  errors and unreasonably long parse times.
- Fixed how some nodes' attribute setters handle input.
- Fixed multiple bugs in the tokenizer's handling of invalid markup.
- Fixed bugs in the implementation of SmartList and StringMixIn.
- Fixed some broken example code in the README; other copyedits.
- Other bugfixes and code cleanup.

v0.1.1 (released September 21, 2012):

- Added support for Comments (<!-- foo -->) and Wikilinks ([[foo]]).
- Added corresponding ifilter_links() and filter_links() methods to Wikicode.
- Fixed a bug when parsing incomplete templates.
- Fixed strip_code() to affect the contents of headings.
- Various copyedits in documentation and comments.

v0.1 (released August 23, 2012):

- Initial release.
