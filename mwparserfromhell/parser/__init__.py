    Actual parsing is a two-step process: first, the text is split up into a
    series of tokens by the :class:`.Tokenizer`, and then the tokens are
    converted into trees of :class:`.Wikicode` objects and :class:`.Node`\\ s
    by the :class:`.Builder`.

    Instances of this class or its dependents (:class:`.Tokenizer` and
    :class:`.Builder`) should not be shared between threads. :meth:`parse` can
    be called multiple times as long as it is not done concurrently. In
    general, there is no need to do this because parsing should be done through
    :func:`mwparserfromhell.parse`, which creates a new :class:`.Parser` object
    as necessary.
