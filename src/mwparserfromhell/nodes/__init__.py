This package contains :class:`.Wikicode` "nodes", which represent a single unit
of wikitext, such as a Template, an HTML tag, a Heading, or plain text. The
node "tree" is far from flat, as most types can contain additional
:class:`.Wikicode` types within them - and with that, more nodes. For example,
the name of a :class:`.Template` is a :class:`.Wikicode` object that can
contain text or more templates.
